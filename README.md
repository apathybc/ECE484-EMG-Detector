# ECE484-EMG-Detector
A muscle sensor gets a reading from 0-1023 based on how hard the area that is being looked at is flexed. When no movement is detected the reading will be 0, while flexing in the area happens the reading will increase based on how hard you are flexing. Here is a link to a data: [Three-Lead EMG sensor datasheet.](https://dlnmh9ip6v2uc.cloudfront.net/datasheets/Sensors/Biometric/Muscle%20Sensor%20v3%20Users%20Manual.pdf)
<br><br>
The only pins that you will need to use on the Arduino are GND, Analog Pin 0, and Digital pin 2 .
<br><br>
// D port LED pin : PD2
<br>
// C port EMG pin : PC0

In my uploaded file, you can read through my code to get an understanding on what is going on, there is plently of comments to help guide the user.
